  An ORB to validate DNS zones and deploy them to production. This
  enables all DNS zones to be stored in a Github repo. A valid
  change to zone file in git automatically gets deployed to production.
  This is how you work smarter instead of harder!

# What will your orb allow users to accomplish?
# Descriptions should be short, simple, and informative.

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
